Most modern C++ compilers handle returning by value efficiently using a technique known as **Return Value Optimization (RVO)** and **Named Return Value Optimization (NRVO)**. These optimizations prevent unnecessary copies when returning objects by value. Here are the major compilers that implement RVO and NRVO:

### 1. **GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)**
   - **RVO**: GCC performs Return Value Optimization and Named Return Value Optimization by default.
   - **Version**: RVO has been available since GCC 3.x, and modern versions (GCC 9 and later) handle RVO/NRVO well, following the C++17 standard which mandates certain cases of RVO.
   
### 2. **Clang/LLVM**
   - **RVO**: Clang also implements RVO and NRVO by default, and optimizes return values very efficiently.
   - **Version**: RVO has been available for quite some time in Clang, and it fully supports the mandatory RVO introduced by C++17.
   
### 3. **MSVC (Microsoft Visual C++)**
   - **RVO**: MSVC has supported RVO and NRVO since Visual Studio 2015 (compiler version 19.00). MSVC also follows C++17’s rule, where RVO is guaranteed in certain situations.
   - **Version**: Full RVO support, as required by C++17, is included in the MSVC compilers shipped with Visual Studio 2017 and later.

### 4. **Intel C++ Compiler (ICC)**
   - **RVO**: Intel's C++ compiler implements RVO and NRVO, optimizing return values by default.
   - **Version**: It has supported RVO since earlier versions, and as with GCC and Clang, the support is aligned with modern C++ standards.

### **RVO in C++17 and Beyond**
   - As of **C++17**, compilers are required to perform RVO in some situations, such as when returning a local object from a function. This means that in these cases, RVO is guaranteed by the language standard itself. Before C++17, RVO was an optional optimization, and compilers would apply it when possible.

### Example Case of Mandatory RVO in C++17:
```cpp
OrderBookEntry createOrder() {
    return OrderBookEntry("2024-09-11", "productX", OrderBookType::bid, 100.0, 5.0);
}
```
In this case, C++17 mandates that no copy or move operation takes place. The object is constructed directly in the caller's memory space.

### Conclusion
If you're using a modern compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC, or ICC), RVO and NRVO will be handled efficiently, and you can generally rely on returning objects by value without worrying about performance penalties, especially in C++17 and later standards.

Let me know if you'd like any further details on compiler optimizations!

-------------------------------------------------------

Yes, **g++** (the GNU C++ compiler) implements **Return Value Optimization (RVO)** and **Named Return Value Optimization (NRVO)** by default, just like GCC.

### Specifics for g++:

1. **RVO**:
   - g++ performs **RVO** automatically when returning an object by value. This means the compiler constructs the object directly in the caller's memory space, avoiding unnecessary copies.
   
2. **NRVO**:
   - g++ also applies **NRVO**, which optimizes cases where a named local variable is returned by value, potentially eliminating copies or moves.

3. **C++17 Mandatory RVO**:
   - From **C++17** onwards, g++ follows the standard's rule that mandates **RVO** in certain cases (e.g., returning a local object directly). In such situations, RVO is guaranteed, meaning no copy or move is performed.
   
4. **g++ Versions**:
   - Any version of g++ from **GCC 3.x** onward supports RVO and NRVO.
   - For C++17 mandatory RVO, make sure you're using **g++ 7.1** or later to take full advantage of the optimization as required by the standard.

### Example:
Here’s a simple example where g++ would apply RVO:
```cpp
OrderBookEntry createOrder() {
    return OrderBookEntry("2024-09-11", "productX", OrderBookType::bid, 100.0, 5.0);
}
```
When compiled with g++ using C++17 or later, the compiler will guarantee no copies or moves are made, constructing the object directly in the caller's location.

You can verify if RVO is applied by compiling your code with optimization flags and inspecting the assembly output:
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -fno-elide-constructors -S your_file.cpp
```
The `-fno-elide-constructors` option disables RVO, allowing you to compare the optimized and non-optimized versions.

### Conclusion:
Yes, **g++** handles RVO and NRVO efficiently, especially in C++17 and later versions where RVO is mandatory in certain cases. If you're using g++ 7.1 or newer, you can rely on these optimizations.
